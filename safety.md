Scammers frequently target crypto users and the EthStaker community, and unfortunately we observe the impact of this from time to time.

The following are key tips we have learned over time to help stay safe. This content has previously been posted in different formats on other locations like the EthStaker Discord and Reddit. The overall guidance here is the same.

**What to expect from EthStaker:**
- We will never DM you (direct message) for support. All support is done in public on the [EthStaker Discord](https://dsc.gg/ethstaker) and at [r/ethstaker](https://reddit.com/r/ethstaker). There is no other private Discord server.
- There is no ticket system or private support.
- We will never ask for your private keys, seed phrase, or personal information.
- We will never ask you to enter your seed phrase into an online interface.
- We will never ask you to send ETH or connect your wallet.
- We will never offer tokens, exclusive NFTs, or airdrops.


**Wallet Safety:**
- Use hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor for storing significant funds, long-term holdings, or validator withdrawal addresses.
- Do not use MetaMask or other software / browser wallets for cold storage. 
- Never type your seed phrase or private key into any website, app, or DApp, even if it looks legitimate. 
- If you EVER stored a seed on LastPass, consider that wallet compromised! LastPass is frequently at fault for users seeing their wallets inexplicably drained, even years after removal!


**Stay Safe on Discord:**
- Disable DMs and friend requests in your Discord settings (Settings → Content & Social → Social permissions) 
- Watch for impersonators.
- Check how long someone has been in the server and whether you have mutual friends or shared servers.


**Verify sources:**
- If you’re given a link, Github repo, or software - search for it in our Discord! If it’s legit, it’ll have been mentioned numerous times. If the link isn’t anywhere to be found - it’s not real!
- If someone is chatting with you, search their history in our Discord - new members with no message history are not likely to be legitimately helping you.


**What to do if you are contacted by a scammer:**
- Ignore or report it in the #report-scams channel in the EthStaker Discord. Do not engage privately.
