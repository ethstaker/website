We're proud to partner with OVH to offer discount codes to the community.

At EthStaker, we always advocate for stakers to run their own hardware at home if possible for maximum decentralization. But we also understand that this isn't always possible for stakers who do not have sufficient internet bandwidth or power availability at their home. 

EthStaker has recommended OVHcloud officially since 2024 and detailed this more [on our blog](https://paragraph.com/@ethstaker/securing-the-ethereum-protocol-using-ovhcloud). 

Over the years EthStaker used OVHcloud services for a variety of purposes including the Rescue Node, a Checkpoint Sync node, and spinning up new testnet validator nodes. To illustrate this in more detail, EthStaker and OVHcloud have published [a case study](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/case-studies/ethstaker) with more detail.

If you're considering using a cloud provider for a testnet, an experiment, your own private node or even for a mainnet validator, you're welcome to use this OVH discount code (see below).
