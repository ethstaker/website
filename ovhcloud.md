Over the years we have used OVHcloud services for a variety of purposes including spinning up new testnet validator nodes and recommending it for stakers who do not have sufficient internet bandwidth or power availability at their home to stake on mainnet. 

EthStaker has recommended OVHcloud officially since 2024 and detailed this more [on our blog](https://paragraph.com/@ethstaker/securing-the-ethereum-protocol-using-ovhcloud). 

To illustrate this in more detail, EthStaker and OVHcloud have published [a case study](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/case-studies/ethstaker) with more detail.
